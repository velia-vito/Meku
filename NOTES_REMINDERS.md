# Notes & Reminders

1. Audio Machine need a very narrow/specific set of controls.

   - Analog range, static behavior. You cant have two switches, one being toggle and the other
     always springing back.

   - Using things like a button + indicator light is skumorphic instead of the more modern
     toggle button that uses color + position for the same control + indicator action

   - How to handle discrete inputs? like drop-downs and navigation?
