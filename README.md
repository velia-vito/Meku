# Meku UI

__TL; DR__ A UI Kit for Flutter aimed at creative applications/workflows.

Most UI Libraries are aimed at very specific use cases. Both Microsoft's Fluent and Google's
Material3 are aimed for general purpose application where the primary interactions are data entry
and data display. Apple's Human Interface Guidelines are more of a collection of general principles
coupled with well designed components more than a dedicated UI library. IBM's Carbon design is
primarily targeted at enterprise level data analytics applications and it shows in Carbon Design's
focus on clarity in data presentation. Meku (The *romaji* for "make") is similarly primarily
targeted at creative workflows, it draws inspiration from the UIs of creative applications like Code
IDE's, Editing software like Premier Pro & Clip Studio Paint, and Game UIs. THe aim is to allow you
a foundational UI toolkit that allows you to create User Interfaces that look good and help users
create what they want without having to fight the application itself.
